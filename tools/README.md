# tools/

## macOS

Requires Node 22.18+, git, and Java 25. Install Java with `brew install openjdk@25`;
`mac.mjs` uses Homebrew's JDK directly, so no system Java changes are needed.

```sh
node tools/mac.mjs launch --backend sim             # free simulated team
node tools/mac.mjs stop --profile sim
node tools/mac.mjs launch --repo /path/to/repo --use-claude-login
node tools/mac.mjs stop                            # save/quit game, stop Foreman
```

The launcher installs npm dependencies on first use, runs the Fabric development client,
and waits for the studio world. It reuses a running Foreman or game from the same profile.
Use `--dev` for mute/no focus/no notifications; `--no-game` or `--no-foreman` to run just
one component; `--no-wait` to return immediately while Minecraft builds. Repeat
`--foreman-arg VALUE` to pass extra Foreman options. Logs and process records live in
`artifacts/logs/mac-*.log` and `artifacts/run/mac-*.json`. `stop` only signals processes
recorded by this launcher. macOS uses Notification Center for agent decisions.
The screenshot QA command, `node tools/qa.mjs`, also uses this launcher on macOS.

## Windows

Windows PowerShell 5.1+ and Node 22.18+. `launch.ps1` installs the npm dependencies it needs on the
first run (`npm ci` in `foreman/` and `tools/`); the Gradle wrapper downloads Gradle, Minecraft
and Fabric by itself. Java 25 must be installed (Temurin 25: https://adoptium.net).

## Daily use

```powershell
tools\launch.ps1                              # claude backend, state in ~/.agentcraft, Foreman :7878, DevBridge :7879
tools\launch.ps1 -Repo C:\code\life-tracker   # also register a repo with the Foreman
tools\launch.ps1 -Backend sim                 # scripted demo team (no API calls), demo repo in sandbox/
tools\launch.ps1 -Showcase                    # static showcase state (sim); -Showcase late for the later one
tools\stop.ps1                                # stop what launch.ps1 started (game + Foreman)
tools\stop.ps1 -Game                          # just the game: agents keep working, relaunch any time
```

From `cmd.exe` or Explorer: `tools\launch.cmd` / `tools\stop.cmd` (same arguments).

`launch.ps1`:
1. Reuses a running Foreman for `<home>/<profile>` (its `foreman.json` pid alive + port answering),
   otherwise starts one in the background (hidden console; log `artifacts\logs\foreman-<profile>.log`).
2. Builds if needed and starts Minecraft (`gradlew runClient`, `GRADLE_USER_HOME` =
   `<repo>\.gradle-home`), passing `AGENTCRAFT_PORT`, `AGENTCRAFT_DEV_PORT`, `AGENTCRAFT_HOME`,
   `AGENTCRAFT_PROFILE`, `AGENTCRAFT_MUTE=0`, `AGENTCRAFT_FOCUS=1` to the game. Log: `artifacts\logs\game.log`.
3. Waits until the HQ world is ready and prints what runs where and how to stop it.

If the game of this checkout is already running it is reused (one client per checkout: they share
`mod/run`). Quitting the game window leaves the Foreman running (agents keep working); the next
`launch.ps1` reuses it.

| parameter | default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-Backend sim\|claude` | `claude` (`AGENTCRAFT_BACKEND`) | `-Showcase` implies `sim` |
| `-Repo <path>[,<path>]` | | registered at start, or sent as `repo.add` to a running Foreman |
| `-Profile <name>` | backend name; `showcase` / `showcase-late` | state lives in `<home>/<profile>` |
| `-Showcase [busy\|late]` | | hold a static scripted state (QA screenshots); always a fresh (`--reset`) profile |
| `-Home <dir>` | `~/.agentcraft` (`AGENTCRAFT_HOME`); with `-Dev`: `<main checkout>\.agentcraft-home` | **QA/tests must pass the project home** |
| `-Port N` / `-DevPort N` | 7878 / 7879 (`AGENTCRAFT_PORT` / `AGENTCRAFT_DEV_PORT`) | 3000/5173/8080 are refused |
| `-Dev` | | unattended runs: muted, never steals focus, no toasts, Gradle daemon exits after 30 idle min |
| `-Reset` | | wipe the profile before starting (new Foreman only) |
| `-Speed x`, `-Autostart`, `-Goal "..."` | | sim speed / start the scripted goal / submit a goal at start |
| `-ForemanArgs @('--workers','kit,wren')` | | extra Foreman flags (`npm run start -- --help`) |
| `-Notify` / `-NoNotify` | Foreman default (on for claude) | Windows toasts |
| `-NoGame`, `-NoForeman`, `-NoWait` | | only the Foreman / only the game / don't wait for the world |
| `-GradleHome <dir>` | `GRADLE_USER_HOME` or `<main checkout>\.gradle-home` | |
| `-TimeoutSec N` | 600 | how long to wait for the world |
| `-SummaryJson <file>` | | machine-readable result (what was started or reused, pids, ports, logs) |
| `-DryRun` | | print the Foreman command, the game command and the game env; start nothing |

`stop.ps1` stops only what `launch.ps1` started, using the run files in `artifacts\run\`
(pid + process start time, so a reused pid is never touched): the game via the DevBridge
`dev.quit` (world saved), the Foreman via Ctrl+Break into its hidden console (the Foreman saves
its state and releases `foreman.json`, like Ctrl+C in a terminal), then, after `-TimeoutSec`
(30), a force-kill of only those process trees. A Foreman that `launch.ps1` reused but did not
start is left alone. `-Game` / `-Foreman` / `-Profile` / `-Home` / `-Port` narrow it down;
`-FromSummary <launch summary>` stops exactly what one launch started; `-StopDaemon` also stops
this checkout's Gradle daemon (never another checkout's).

## Multiplayer harness

`mp.mjs` prepares Loom's development launch configuration once, then starts a dedicated
server, one local Foreman per player, and one or two clients. Requires Node 22.18+, Java 25,
and `npm ci --prefix tools` / `npm ci --prefix foreman`. Uses portable macOS, Linux and Windows
launch paths. Windows process control uses the existing PowerShell helpers and background
runner; the Windows changes have unit coverage but have not been run on Windows.

```sh
node tools/mp.mjs up --slot 92 --clients 2 --backend sim --json
node tools/mp.mjs status --slot 92 --json
node tools/mp.mjs down --slot 92 --json
```

On the swarm machine, launch through `game node tools/mp.mjs up --slot 92 ...`.
Use `--gradle-command gw-raw` under `game` so preparation uses the swarm environment and
does not try to reacquire the Gradle lock already held by `game`. Keep the slot held for
the entire live check (including `down`), for example with a shell script run by `game`.
For separate preparation, run `gw -I ../tools/lib/mp/export-launch.gradle mpExportLaunch
-PmpLaunchFile=../artifacts/run/mp-92/launch.json --no-configuration-cache --console=plain`
from `mod/`, then `game node tools/mp.mjs up --slot 92 --no-build ...`.

`--slot` is required (0..99), with the campaign's fixed port formulas. Slot 92 uses server
25692, Foremen 27984/27985 and DevBridges 8084/8085. `--clients` defaults to 2 and accepts 1.
The default backend is `sim`; `--backend claude` requires your usual credentials.
`--home` defaults to this checkout's `.agentcraft-home`, and `--profile` to `mp-<slot>`;
client profiles append `-a` / `-b`. Never use a shared home/profile with another launcher.

Each JVM has an explicit `-Xms256M` and a **2G maximum heap**, independently configurable
with `--server-heap` / `--client-heap` or `AGENTCRAFT_MP_SERVER_HEAP` /
`AGENTCRAFT_MP_CLIENT_HEAP` (flag wins; accepted range 256M..8G). Native memory and graphics
use additional RAM. Clients use 30 FPS in a 960×540 window and preserve the template
graphics preset. In Minecraft 26.3, Fancy applies render distance 16 and simulation distance
12 after loading options; the dedicated server separately limits view distance to 6 and
simulation distance to 4. The client minimum simulation distance is 5. Existing options
persist; delete only a generated client directory's `options.txt` to reseed it.
`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`, `_JAVA_OPTIONS` and `JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS` must be unset
so injected JVM flags cannot override the caps. Gradle's own memory configuration is unchanged.

Java 25 is checked before preparation, including with `--no-build`. Gradle preparation
inherits `JAVA_HOME` and `GRADLE_USER_HOME`; when the latter is unset it uses this checkout's
`.gradle-home`. The portable default is `sh ./gradlew` on POSIX or `gradlew.bat` via PowerShell on Windows. Override the executable
with `--gradle-command` or `AGENTCRAFT_MP_GRADLE`. On Windows a `.bat` or `.cmd` override runs
through the same PowerShell invocation, because Node refuses to spawn a batch file directly
(`EINVAL`); a bare file name found in `mod/` is run from there. `--no-build` reuses this slot's previously
exported metadata; export again after changing code, Java/Loom settings or platforms.
The init script depends on Loom 1.18.2's `configureClientLaunch` (including `downloadAssets`
and platform natives when needed), then reads Loom's real task classpaths, JVM arguments
and DLI configuration
without running `runClient` / `runServer` or editing `mod/build.gradle`. Direct client
launches use separate working directories and `--gameDir`, preserving Loom's native/asset
configuration. Java argfiles keep Windows command lines short.

Everything is recorded under `artifacts/run/mp-<slot>/`: `state.json`, `launch.json`, logs,
Java argfiles, `server/` and `client-a/` / `client-b/`. The local server is offline and bound
to loopback, accepts the Minecraft EULA for this development run, has both test players
opped, enables AgentCraft multiplayer, and seeds a superflat world with grass at y=64.
Worlds and client options persist across `down` / `up`; use a fresh slot directory for a
fresh world. The current pre-MP-F mod ignores the new multiplayer config; plot/relay checks
require their campaign packets to land.

`up` refuses occupied ports (checked before the Gradle step and again right after it, before
anything is started) or an existing live run, waits up to `--timeout` seconds
(default 600) per startup stage, and rolls back on failure/interruption. Readiness requires
every client's `dev.state` to show a loaded remote world, the expected player and its own
synced Foreman. Before MP-12, remote means `world.name === null` plus a loaded dimension;
it does not imply that the server has sent the multiplayer hello. The harness sets
`AGENTCRAFT_DEV_REMOTE=1` for the game clients it launches (not for the server or the Foremen),
because it drives them through the DevBridge commands that act on a remote server; a player's
own client must not set it.

The library scans each client stdout log from the beginning for terminal DevBridge errors.
`up` handles a bind failure by stopping only that client, waiting 35 seconds on macOS or
65 seconds on Linux for TIME_WAIT, and relaunching it once. Windows uses no cooldown
(unverified). It prints the client, port, cause and log path with the recovery notice.
The retry shares the readiness stage's `--timeout` budget; insufficient time, a second bind
failure or a non-bind bridge error fails immediately and triggers rollback. Thus an immediate
`down` followed by `up` can take longer than a cold start; allow time for this recovery.
The port preflight uses a TCP connection, because Node's address reuse makes a `listen()`
probe unreliable for detecting Java's TIME_WAIT bind failures.
`status --json` includes process identities and the last startup states, dated by
`statesCapturedAt`; those DevBridge snapshots are historical. Status reports `ready`,
`partial` or `stopped` from live PID/start-time checks. JSON stdout contains one object;
progress goes to stderr. Success is `{ok:true, ...summary}`; failure is `{ok:false,error}`
and exits nonzero. Summary version 1 has these fields:

| Fields | Shape |
|---|---|
| `version`, `slot`, `phase` | `1`, slot number, `ready` / `partial` / `stopped` |
| `home`, `profile`, `stateFile` | Strings identifying the run |
| `error`, `statesCapturedAt` | Last startup error / ISO snapshot timestamp, or `null` |
| `server` | `port`, `heap`, `gameDir`, stdout `log`, `debugLog`, boolean `running` |
| `clients[]` | `id`, `username`, `profile`, `foremanPort`, `devPort`, `heap`, `gameDir`, `log`, `debugLog`, `foremanLog`, booleans `running` / `foremanRunning`, last `state` or `null` |
| `processes[]` | `kind`, `client` (id or `null`), `log`, recorded `pid` (or `null`), `primaryRunning`, live `processes[]` |
| `processes[].processes[]` | Only `pid`, `startTime`, `role` (`primary`, `wrapper`, `member`) |

A stopped run can retain historical states and process entries; each live process list is empty.

Always run `down`, including after a failed `up`. It stops only recorded PID/start-time
identities, can recover a launcher crash using unique per-process launch markers, and
never kills shared Gradle daemons or foreign port owners. It asks an owned DevBridge to
quit, then signals the clients, Foremen and dedicated server, with bounded waits and a
force-stop fallback. On Windows only Foremen receive Ctrl+Break (a JVM answers it with a
thread dump) and clients get their post-`dev.quit` wait. The Windows server has no stdin
under the background runner, so there `up` enables RCON for it: loopback only, a random
password, and whichever port is free (kept in `state.json`; the slot's block has none for
it). `down` sends the console `stop` through it and waits up to 30 seconds for the save and
exit before killing (unit-tested, not yet run on Windows). When the server had to be killed,
on any platform, `down` says that it was killed without a final save: changes since its last
autosave are lost and the world is still reused. Incomplete cleanup retains the
records and returns an error so
`down` can be retried. Only one controller can take over a stale launcher control lock: a
takeover claims the next generation under `control.lock/` with an exclusive `mkdir`, and the
others get "another up/down is active". Process-table access is required: a sandbox denying `ps` or PowerShell inspection fails before launch.

Later packets can import the harness helpers:

```js
import { clientCommand, waitForClients, readServerEvents, readClientEvents } from './lib/mp/index.mjs';
// plan = the parsed state.json or CLI JSON summary (same server/client fields).
const states = await waitForClients(plan);
await clientCommand(plan, 'a', 'dev.camera', { anchor: 'cam_room' });
await clientCommand(plan, 'b', 'dev.state');
let { events, offset, generation } = readServerEvents(plan, { event: 'hello_sent' });
// pass both back: the generation tells a log replaced by a later `up` from one that only grew
({ events, offset, generation } = readServerEvents(plan, { offset, generation }));
const clientEvents = readClientEvents(plan, 'a'); // retain a separate cursor per file
```

`readServerEvents` and `readClientEvents` read each game directory's `logs/debug.log`,
including DEBUG-level telemetry. They return complete telemetry lines, parsed fields and
a byte offset for incremental reads. Stdout captures remain the startup/error logs.
`clientCommand` uses the existing `DevClient`, with bounded connection
and command timeouts, and always closes its connection. Run `npm test --prefix tools`
for port/CLI, launch isolation, memory caps, PID recovery, cleanup and library checks.
