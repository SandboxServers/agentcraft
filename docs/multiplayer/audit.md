# Multiplayer: Audit Against `main`

> Type: reference. Audience: the coordinator and packet workers.
> Updated: 2026-10-03 (MP-00 spike, `main` @ `0be815d`). Companions: [campaign README](README.md), [work packets](work-packets.md), [MP-00 worknote](worknotes/MP-00.md).

Paths are relative to the repo root; `mod/src/main/java/dev/agentcraft/` is shortened to `main/…` and `mod/src/client/java/dev/agentcraft/client/` to `client/…`. IDs (`A-nn`) are cited by the work packets. "Verified" means the spike ran it on this machine; everything else is read from the code, and inferences are marked.

## 1. Toolchain and baseline (verified)

| ID | Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A-01 | Java 25.0.2, Node 22.12.0, npm 10.9, git 2.52 and Docker 29.1 are installed. | `java -version`, `node --version`, `docker --version` |
| A-02 | `cd mod && gradlew build` succeeds with an isolated `GRADLE_USER_HOME=<repo>/.gradle-home` (cold: about 60 s including the Minecraft and Fabric downloads). | `artifacts/logs/spike-mod-build2.log` (gitignored) |
| A-03 | `gradlew build mcSources` **in one invocation fails** Gradle's task validation (`:compileJava` uses an output of `:genCommonSourcesWithVineflower` without a declared dependency). Run `build` and `mcSources` as separate invocations; both then succeed. Not a code bug, but every packet worker will hit it once. | `artifacts/logs/spike-mod-build.log` |
| A-04 | `cd foreman && npm ci && npm run check`: typecheck passes, **481/482 tests pass**. The one failure, `test/ws.test.ts:118` (`expected [...'unknown'...] to include 'fail'`), is deterministic on this machine. | `artifacts/logs/spike-foreman-check.log` |
| A-05 | Root cause of A-04: the sim demo repo declares `"engines": {"node": ">=22.18"}` and runs its `.ts` tests with plain `node --test` (`sandbox/create-demo.mjs:55-61`). On Node 22.12, `node --test` does not pick up `*.test.ts` files (type stripping arrived later in 22.x), so every CI run in the sim "passes" and the scripted CI failure beat (`foreman/src/agents/sim/scenario.ts:195-200`) never fails. `foreman/package.json` and `tools/package.json` declare only `node >=22`, and the README says "Node 22+". **Inference, strongly supported:** Node ≥ 22.18 turns the suite green. | `sandbox/create-demo.mjs:55-61`; `foreman/package.json` `engines` |

## 2. Dedicated server (verified)

| ID | Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A-06 | `gradlew runServer` boots a dedicated 26.3 server with the mod: Fabric loads 44 mods, common init registers 16 blocks and the six-agent cast, and the server reaches `Done (1.786s)`. `src/main` has no client references (grep finds only a Javadoc mention), `agentcraft.mixins.json` is empty, and the client entrypoint and mixins are environment-gated in `fabric.mod.json`. | `artifacts/logs/spike-runserver.log`; `mod/src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json:12-26`; `main/AgentCraft.java:19` |
| A-07 | `/agentcraft hq` from the dedicated server's console builds the full studio on a default-terrain world (`level-name=spike-world`): planned in 38 ms, applied 346,983 cells in 2,363 ms (152,690 changed, 100 bindings), published layout `studio` rev 1 with 69 anchors, replaced 5,627 non-HQ blocks. `/agentcraft anchors` lists the layout. The command works even though the level is not named "AgentCraft HQ". | `artifacts/logs/spike-runserver-hq.log` lines 81-87 |
| A-08 | With no console input, `runServer` under Gradle does not stop on its own (it autosaves and pauses when empty). Harness tooling must stop a dedicated server with `stop` on stdin or by killing the recorded server pid, never "wait for exit". | spike observation |
| A-09 | The 26.3 client accepts `--quickPlayMultiplayer <host:port>`, so a dev client can join a local dedicated server with no clicks. | `mod/build/mcsrc/net/minecraft/client/main/Main.java:90,211` |

## 3. No networking exists

| ID | Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A-10 | The mod has **no custom networking at all**: no `CustomPacketPayload`, `PayloadTypeRegistry`, `ServerPlayNetworking` or `ClientPlayNetworking`. The only server→client data is vanilla: block states and `StationBlockEntity`'s `binding` string via `getUpdatePacket` / `getUpdateTag`. `ServerPlayConnectionEvents.JOIN` is used only to force game mode. | grep over `mod/src` (0 hits); `main/block/entity/StationBlockEntity.java:55-76`; `main/world/HqWorld.java:36-45` |
| A-11 | Station clicks are handled client-side and return FAIL, so nothing is sent to the server (console terminal, podium, merge station, archive and catalog, lectern, task board). Agents are client-only entities, and clicks on them never reach the server either. | `client/world/StationInteractions.java:40-51`; `client/agents/AgentsFeature.java:115-122` |

## 4. The layout reaches the client only through a shared JVM static

| ID | Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A-12 | `Anchors.current` is one `private static volatile Layout` per JVM. It is filled by the `SERVER_STARTED` load or `publish()` and cleared on `SERVER_STOPPED`. The Javadoc says it outright: "the client (same JVM in singleplayer) reads it directly." | `main/layout/Anchors.java:31,58,64-71,90-95` |
| A-13 | On a remote server, then, every client reader sees `Layout.EMPTY` (inference from A-12): `AgentManager` falls back to a row of agents in front of world spawn, and `HqWorldDriver`, `HqCheck`, `HqClientFeature`, `StatusLampRenderer`, `MonitorFeature`, `Seats`, `AgentLife`, `CameraPath` and `AnchorsDev` bail out or default. | `client/agents/AgentManager.java:140,148,442-451`; `client/hq/HqWorldDriver.java:91`; `client/hq/StatusLampRenderer.java:101-103`; `client/monitor/MonitorFeature.java:172`; `client/agents/Seats.java:82`; `client/agents/AgentLife.java:605`; `client/dev/play/CameraPath.java:195`; `client/world/AnchorsDev.java:25` |
| A-14 | `Anchor` already has an unused `offset(dx, dy, dz)`. `Anchors.Builder.put` is the single path that `spot` / `camera` / `cameraLookAt` go through, so an origin offset in the builder covers every anchor. | `main/layout/Anchor.java:28-30`; `main/layout/Anchors.java:220-223` |
| A-15 | Anchor naming contract: per agent `desk_<id>`, `monitor_<id>`, `seat_<id>`; shared stations `library`, `terminal`, `testbench`, `mergestation`, `meeting`, `lounge`, `user` with slots `<station>_2..N`; fixed `task_wall`, `decision_podium`, `podium_user`, `goal_atrium`, `entrance`, `spawn`; cameras `cam_*`. Names are not studio-scoped, so two studios must live in two `Layout`s, not one. | `main/layout/AnchorNames.java:10-59`; `client/agents/StationAssigner.java:37-45,106-116` |

## 5. Every Foreman-driven world change needs the integrated server

| ID | Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A-16 | `ServerTasks.run` is the single route for client-driven world changes. It calls `getSingleplayerServer()`, returns `false` when there is none, and otherwise queues the task on the integrated server's overworld. | `client/world/ServerTasks.java:24-32` |
| A-17 | `HqWorldDriver.tick` (END_CLIENT_TICK) returns early without an integrated server. Otherwise it recomputes the wanted state on a ForemanState or layout revision change, or every 40 ticks, then scans every block entity within the layout bounds ±3 on the server thread. It sets lamp `STATUS`, podium `OPEN`, merge station `ACTIVE`, monitor `LIT`, and vanilla `CopperBulbBlock.LIT` near the podium and merge anchors. Inputs: agents (active, state family), open decisions, task assignee, repo CI, goal status. Binding keys: `agent:<id>`, `ci:<repoId>`, `ci:#n`, `goal`, `goal:atrium`, `decisions`, `merge`, `beacon`. All of its state is static. | `client/hq/HqWorldDriver.java:58,68-72,87-110,130-187,247-327` |
| A-18 | `DecisionsFeature.syncPodium` (called from the podium renderer every frame) also writes `OPEN` through `ServerTasks`. On a remote server the pending entry is stored even though `run` returned false, so the podium would never change (bug-shaped; inference). | `client/decisions/DecisionsFeature.java:46,120-141`; `client/decisions/DecisionPodiumRenderer.java:99` |
| A-19 | The only `setBinding` call is the server-side builder. Client code never writes block entity fields; it writes only block states, and only via A-16. | `main/hq/Plan.java:378` |
| A-20 | DevBridge server work (`dev.camera`, `dev.release`, `dev.time`, `dev.weather`, `dev.command`, `dev.quit`'s world save) goes through `DevCommands.needServer`, which throws "needs a singleplayer (integrated server) world" on a remote server. | `client/dev/DevCommands.java:207-214,479-541,611-626,684-693,849-889` |

## 6. One static Foreman state, rendered everywhere

| ID | Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A-21 | `Foreman` holds one static `ForemanState` and one `ForemanLink` (to `ws://127.0.0.1:<AGENTCRAFT_PORT>`). This is right for "each player's own Foreman", but nothing can hold a second studio's state. `ForemanState`'s constructor, `receive` and `apply` are package-private; public `inject` / `patch` already accept arbitrary wire JSON. | `client/foreman/Foreman.java:23-24,29`; `client/foreman/ForemanState.java:82,272,333,342,368` |
| A-22 | `Foreman.state()` appears 102 times on 88 lines in 36 files (console 16, decisions 18, taskwall 12, diff 12, library 11, agents 10, hud 9, foreman 4, hq 4, dev/play 3, world 2, monitor 1). Another 35 `UiBits.agentName/userName/…` calls read it indirectly. 8 `Foreman.addListener` sites. | grep (audit agent count) |
| A-23 | Every block-entity renderer draws from the viewer's own static ForemanState, not from block entity data: monitor, task board, merge station, console terminal, status lamp hologram, podium, memory archive. **On a shared server every player would see their own Foreman's data on every studio's screens** (inference). | `client/monitor/MonitorRenderer.java:82`; `client/taskwall/TaskBoardRenderer.java:93`; `client/diff/MergeStationRenderer.java:91,148`; `client/console/ConsoleTerminalRenderer.java:99`; `client/hq/StatusLampRenderer.java:93,126`; `client/decisions/DecisionPodiumRenderer.java:89-99`; `client/library/MemoryArchiveRenderer.java:85-106` |
| A-24 | Other per-JVM statics keyed to "the" studio: `AgentManager.INSTANCE`, `HqWorldDriver` last/lastRevision, `MonitorFeature` LOG_SEQ / AGENT_SEQ / SCREENS, `MergeStationRenderer` queue cache, `DecisionQueue` cachedRevision, `DecisionsFeature` ANSWERING / ANSWERS / PODIUM_PENDING, `MemoryIndex` SEEN, `TaskWallFeature` taskSeq / agentSeq. | `client/agents/AgentManager.java:49`; `client/hq/HqWorldDriver.java:68-69`; `client/monitor/MonitorFeature.java:47-54`; `client/diff/MergeStationRenderer.java:75-76`; `client/decisions/DecisionsFeature.java:42-46` |

## 7. What the world rendering of agents consumes (the public subset)

| ID | Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A-25 | Agent entities (manager, view, nameplate, life, skins) read: `Agent.id`, `name`, `skin`, `state`, `station`, `active`, `paused`, `activity` (nameplate line), plus a derived "awaiting user" that needs open decisions (`kind`, `agentId`, `taskId`) and `Task.assignee`. Colour comes from the id through `cast.json`, not `Agent.color`. | `client/agents/AgentManager.java:135-256`; `client/agents/AgentView.java:65-82`; `client/agents/Nameplate.java:58-105`; `client/agents/StationAssigner.java:29-52` |
| A-26 | Events that animate agents: `agent.say` (`agentId`, `to`, `text`; text length sets listen time) drives bubble, talk pose and head look; a task changing to `done` fires confetti on its assignee. | `client/agents/AgentsFeature.java:84-114`; `client/agents/SpeechBubble.java:54-63,160-171`; `client/agents/AgentLife.java:179-199` |
| A-27 | Free text that can leak code or plans, and where it shows: `Agent.activity` (nameplate, monitor; e.g. "editing src/cli.ts"), `agent.say` text (bubbles), log lines with tool arguments, paths and diff lines (monitors, worst), `Task.title` / `blockedReason` (task wall, merge station), goal text (monitor feed mode, atrium hologram), `Decision.question` (podium; permission prompts contain commands), memory titles (archive), feed text (console terminal), `userName`. | `foreman/src/protocol.ts:80-96,106-124,134-151,191-199`; consumers in A-23 |
| A-28 | Lamps need only status: agent state family, CI per repo, goal status, "a decision is open", "a merge is open". The `goal:atrium` hologram is the exception and shows goal text and task counts. | `client/hq/HqWorldDriver.java:169-185`; `client/hq/StatusLampRenderer.java:93-206` |
| A-29 | Viewer-relative behaviour that is wrong for a visitor: an agent in `waiting_user` walks to the local `mc.player`, and a bubble addressed to "user" is labelled with the *viewer's* name. On a visitor's client, the owner's agents would walk up to and address the visitor. | `client/agents/AgentManager.java:152,259-276`; `client/agents/SpeechBubble.java:164-166` |
| A-30 | What binds a block to an agent: the monitor's BE `binding` (agent id or `feed`, else resolved by the `monitor_<id>` anchor), the lamp's BE `binding`, merge stations by row position (k-th station shows the k-th open merge), archive by scope binding plus shelf position. Podium, task wall and console terminal have no binding and render the whole state. | `client/monitor/MonitorFeature.java:168-200`; `client/diff/MergeStationRenderer.java:109-126`; `client/library/MemoryArchiveRenderer.java:60-109` |
| A-31 | `ClientAgentEntity` ids come from a decreasing counter starting at −10,000 in the singleton `AgentManager`, never reset. One counter for all studios avoids collisions as long as there is one manager. If studios each get their own manager, they need disjoint id ranges (inference). | `client/agents/AgentManager.java:69,355` |

## 8. The HQ is hard-wired to the world origin

| ID | Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A-32 | The studio builder uses absolute constants and literals: `GROUND=64, FLOOR=65, FEET=66`, hall x −24..24 z −10..6, atrium at (0,15), site box `{-46,60,-36, 46,100,54}` (93 × 41 × 91), desk x values, plus many literal coordinates (library, workshop, lounge, meeting, cameras, dormers, chimney). | `main/hq/StudioHqBuilder.java:56-85,185,426-440,926-1094,1308-1323` |
| A-33 | `Plan` is an in-memory box, applied by diffing against the world with `setBlock` and `FLAGS`, connecting blocks in a second pass, then bindings, then a drop and XP sweep. Chunks are loaded synchronously (42 chunks at the origin). It is idempotent and keeps player-changed cells unless `force`. `Plan.set` drops anything outside the box, so a build never writes outside its site. | `main/hq/Plan.java:62-108,138-142,190-213,224-285,294-408` |
| A-34 | `HqLandscape` reshapes the whole site box (hills to about 7 blocks, pond, garden, paths, lychgate, tree rings). Its randomness hashes **absolute** x/z, so translating the plan at apply time (not at plan time) gives every plot the identical studio (inference). | `main/hq/HqLandscape.java:31-43,48-81,583-651` |
| A-35 | `PlanStore` keeps one file, `agentcraft-hq-plan.dat`, in the world root, keyed only by builder id plus box. Another builder's run deletes it. Two plots cannot share it. | `main/hq/PlanStore.java:30-49,99-117`; `main/hq/HqFeature.java:104` |
| A-36 | `HqWorld`: `isHq` compares the level name to `"AgentCraft HQ"`. First start runs `setworldspawn 0 65 0`, time 12000 and clear weather. Every start applies world-wide game rules (no daylight or weather cycle, no mobs, keep inventory, …, `max_block_modifications 1,000,000`, `LOG_ADMIN_COMMANDS` off). Every join forces SURVIVAL or SPECTATOR players into CREATIVE. A dedicated server with the default `level-name=world` skips all of it, plus anchor loading and auto-build (inference). | `main/world/HqWorld.java:24,36-45,48-50,58-68,73-96` |
| A-37 | `HqFeature`: auto-build on `SERVER_STARTED` when the world has no anchors (`AGENTCRAFT_HQ_AUTOBUILD=0` turns it off). `/agentcraft hq [builder] [force]` (op level 2) builds at the fixed site, publishes the single layout, and **moves the global world spawn** to the `spawn` anchor on every build. | `main/hq/HqFeature.java:29-54,55-64,75-118`; `main/command/AgentCraftCommands.java:45-50` |
| A-38 | `TestRoomBuilder` is absolute too (`FLOOR=64`, clears x −16..16, z −32..16) and places blocks directly with `setBlock` and `UPDATE_CLIENTS`, bypassing `Plan`. It is a development fixture; nothing in multiplayer needs it at an offset. | `main/hq/TestRoomBuilder.java:49-94,217,339-353` |
| A-39 | `AutoWorld` opens or creates the local "AgentCraft HQ" world on the first title screen: creative, peaceful, cheats on, superflat with grass at y=64. It runs before a player can pick a server. Its only off switch is `AGENTCRAFT_AUTOWORLD=0`. | `client/AutoWorld.java:46-69,73-110`; `client/ClientEnv.java:29` |
| A-40 | QA's contract states "Coordinates are absolute world coordinates". `tools/scenes/qa.json` uses anchors with an absolute fallback camera. The other scenes (`agents*.json`, `console.json`, `displays*.json`, `phase1.json`) use raw coordinates around the origin. As long as singleplayer keeps the studio at plot 0 = origin, QA is unaffected. | `docs/QA.md:97-98`; `tools/scenes/*.json` |

## 9. Shared-file hotspots (sizes)

| File | Lines | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `main/hq/StudioHqBuilder.java` | 1330 | Only needs an origin passed to `Plan` and the anchors builder. Keep it in local coordinates. |
| `main/hq/HqLandscape.java` | 800 | Unchanged if translation happens at apply time (A-34). |
| `client/dev/DevCommands.java` | 1003 | Every `needServer` site (A-20). One owner. |
| `client/foreman/ForemanState.java` | 534 | Read-only for this campaign. The publisher listens; nobody edits it. |
| `client/agents/AgentManager.java` | 452 | The multi-studio agents packet owns it. |
| `main/hq/Plan.java` | 415 | The build-at-offset packet owns it. |
| `client/hq/HqWorldDriver.java` | 329 | The world-intent packet owns it. |
| `main/layout/Anchors.java` | 245 | Made per-studio once, by the foundation. |
| `client/ClientFeatures.java` / `main/AgentCraft.java` | 45 / 41 | One wiring line per feature. The foundation adds every multiplayer line once. |
| `foreman/src/protocol.ts` / `client/foreman/Protocol.java` | 504 / 325 | **Untouched by v1.** No Foreman protocol change is needed. |

## 10. What the handoff assumed that the spike confirmed or changed

| ID | Finding |
|---|---|
| A-41 | **Confirmed:** the jar loads on a dedicated server, and the server-side builder works there (A-06, A-07). The singleplayer assumptions are exactly `AutoWorld`, `ServerTasks` / `HqWorldDriver` / `DecisionsFeature.syncPodium`, and `DevCommands.needServer`, plus the server-side singletons in §8. |
| A-42 | **Added:** the anchor layout never reaches a remote client (A-12, A-13), so a "layout sync" payload is a hard prerequisite for rendering anything, including your own studio. The handoff's plan did not list it. |
| A-43 | **Added:** every block-entity renderer shows the viewer's own Foreman state on every studio (A-23). Studio-aware renderers are required for correctness, not only for privacy. |
| A-44 | **Added:** the mod has no unit-test source set and no game tests. All verification today is in-game through the DevBridge plus screenshot QA. Pure-logic multiplayer code (codecs, redaction, plot math, intent validation) needs JUnit, and server behaviour needs a headless test path. |
| A-45 | **Added:** the baseline Foreman suite is red on Node < 22.18 (A-04, A-05). Every worker machine needs Node ≥ 22.18. |
